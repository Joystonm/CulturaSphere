### 1. Fixed Leaflet CSS Import Issue
- Created a custom leaflet.css file in the styles directory
- Updated TasteToGeoVisualizer.jsx to import the custom CSS
- Added the CSS import to App.jsx
- This resolves the error: `Failed to resolve import "leaflet/dist/leaflet.css"`

### 2. Fixed PDF Generation
- Installed jsPDF and jspdf-autotable dependencies
- Implemented proper PDF generation in TravelPDFGenerator.jsx
- Created test files to verify PDF generation works correctly
- Now downloads proper PDF files instead of text files

## How to Test

1. For the Taste-to-Geo Visualizer:
   - Navigate to the FlavorFusion page
   - Add some interests (e.g., "Jazz music", "Sushi", "Art museums")
   - Click "Visualize Destinations"
   - The map should now display properly with destination markers

2. For the Travel PDF Generator:
   - Navigate to the FlavorFusion page
   - Fill out the destination, dates, and interests
   - Select a narrative style
   - Click "Generate Travel Guide"
   - Click "Download PDF" - this should now download a proper PDF file

## Additional Test Files
- `/client/public/test-pdf.html` - A standalone HTML file to test PDF generation
- `/client/src/test-pdf.js` - A JavaScript module to test PDF generation

## Dependencies Added
- leaflet: ^1.9.4
