# Taste-to-Geo Visualizer Update

## Enhanced Destination Matching Algorithm

The Taste-to-Geo Visualizer has been significantly improved to provide more personalized and varied destination recommendations based on your interests.

### Key Improvements:

1. **Expanded Destination Database**
   - Added 7 new destinations: Kyoto, Paris, New Orleans, Marrakech, Buenos Aires, Istanbul, and Berlin
   - Each destination now has 12 options instead of just 5

2. **Smarter Interest Matching**
   - Each destination now has 15-20 associated tags for more precise matching
   - Interests are broken down into individual words for better partial matching
   - Special category matching for food, music, art, nature, and history interests

3. **Dynamic Match Reasons**
   - Match reasons are now generated based on your specific interests
   - Custom reasons are created when your interests strongly align with destination features
   - More varied explanations of why destinations match your tastes

4. **More Varied Results**
   - All destinations start with the same base score (70)
   - Your interests can significantly change which destinations rank highest
   - Added slight randomization to prevent identical scores

### How to Use:

1. Enter multiple interests separated by adding them one at a time
2. Try specific interests like "jazz music," "street food," "ancient history," or "modern art"
3. The more specific your interests, the more personalized your results will be
4. Try combinations of different types of interests (e.g., food + music + architecture)

### Examples:

- "Anime, ramen, technology" → Tokyo will rank highest
- "Jazz, creole food, history" → New Orleans will rank highest
- "Architecture, Gaudi, Mediterranean" → Barcelona will rank highest
- "Electronic music, street art, history" → Berlin will rank highest

The visualizer now provides truly personalized recommendations that respond meaningfully to your cultural interests!
